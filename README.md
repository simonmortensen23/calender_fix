 ### Front End Developer Role
 Front end developers play an important role in developing an engaging user facing web applications, aiming to make sure the user stays on and returns to the site is a major objective. Front end developers work on the user interface and user experience, maintaining responsiveness and accessibility of the application. Having an understanding of how the backend part of an application works is helpful to a front end developer, as it helps to tie the two together in an approriate manner.
 
 ## Features
 
 ## Future Features
  - In the future I would like to implement member groups, so the owner of the task can add a group of people instead of individual people.
  - In the future I would like to implement another member role, editor, so designated people other than the owner can edit tasks.
  - In the future I would like to implement the ability to create an event, that the user can add tasks to. 
  
 ## Bugs
 ### Fixed
  - Had no gitignore for the initial commits, so the env.py was pushed to github. Added the .gitignore and changed the values of the secret key and made a new cloudinary account.
